* Optionally displays the blip's descriptive text, if there is any, for the shortcode version of Blipper Widget only (i.e. the descriptive text is not shown for the widget).
* Separates the styling of the widget and the shortcode so that the user can either use the settings on the widget form or CSS to style the widget version of Blipper Widget.  The shortcode version always uses CSS.

* Fixes display of widgets styled by the widget settings form.
* Blipper Widget output checked and validated by [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).
